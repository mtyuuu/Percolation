#About question
1. Add virtual nodes at the top of the first row and the bottom of the last row to support isFull and percolates in constant time.
2. This solution will cause a back wash issue. Becuase the top and bottom virtual nodes are unioned (in same component)
So we use two union-find with 1 virtual node each. One is for isFull, one is for percolates.
