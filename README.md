#Percolation
Week 1 Programming assignment of Course "Algorithms, Part 1" from Princeton University in Coursera.
Question:
Given a N-by-N grid of sites. Each site is either open or blocked. A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites.We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row. In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open sites connected to the top row and that process fills some open site on the bottom row.
